I was walking along the streets today and noticed that:<br>
When I see people step out of their cars, I have the slightest but very present urge to immediately run over, jump in and drive away. I am then left almost paralyzed for a few seconds by the notion that I may actually end up doing this at some point, so I quickly walk myself through the different steps that car-jacking involves. But the issue is, every car is different. Maybe the gear stick is somewhere else. Maybe the person, anticipating my car-jacking, removed the steering wheel with the intention of leaving me to suffer. Maybe THEY just got back from stealing that car and I was stealing a <img src="gmap.jpg">stolen car. Many things to consider. But my point is, I think often about stealing cars.

"Why is this important?" You may ask upon hearing my confession. Yesterday I saw a dog chase and kill a rabbit. I stood there and stared for a long time until I realized the rabbit was still barely alive. I rushed over and pushed the dog away, hoping it could still hobble away. You need to know that in this moment, I was not acting on any sort of logic, I KNOW that rabbits fuck like crazy and one life is not an issue but that did not occur to me during that moment, as I watched it stop breathing with its eyes still open. I picked it up and laid it to rest on some softer grass. That night I washed my hands with three different kinds of alcohol, mosquito spray, 30spf sunscreen and an off-brand skin lotion; I had recently learned about wasting disease in mammals and was scared about getting sick from holding the rabbit.<br><br>I received a envelope in the mail today, and apparently enclosed was one million dollars. But the thing is, I was so preoccupied with whether the envelope had been sealed with someone's spit or not; I didn't even notice what was inside.
