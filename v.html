<P style="margin-right:500px;">i wanted to create something, not just for this program or anything at all. but for some reason i really wanted to create something almost like a parallel world. something like that. if you've read through the other stuff i put into the different projects, you might notice moments of self-doubt within my work. i wonder what people think when they see the things i make. i worry that the feelings and effort i've sunk into it don't pay out. <br><br>but maybe i just can't achieve that right now. maybe it's okay to be a little bad at telling stories. i'm gonna be okay with that<br>i want to take the time to become an artist with stories worth telling and the skills to make it happen. i want to keep telling this story about going in life and shouldering grief and coming to terms with yourself and the things that have happened<br><br><br>unfortunately when i exit that period of clarity, <br>the feeling of peace you experience<br>when you feel like you have a clear goal and path in life, <br>i remember that bills exist.<br> and taxes. all the taxes.</P>

<p style="margin-right:180px;">i lost a good friend a long time ago and i don't know where they are or how they are but they continue to influence the way i approach art. n i think that's why i wanted to make things like this so much</p>
